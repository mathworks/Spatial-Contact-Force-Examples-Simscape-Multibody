%% Multibody Rolling Disk, Custom Force Law
%
% This example shows how to model a custom force law that integrated with
% the Spatial Contact Force block.  The custom force law modifies the
% coefficients of friction based on the disk's position.
% 
% Two spinning disks are released above a floor with an initial
% translational speed.  The friction between the disks and the floor slows
% the rate at which they spin and slide.  When the disk with the custom force
% law reaches a patch of ice (shown visually in the animation), the
% coefficients of friction are reduced.  The rotational speeds of the disks
% and trajectories of the disks differ, showing the effect of the custom
% force law.
