%% Multibody Point Cloud Contact Cylinder on Ramp
%
% This example models a cylinder rolling down a ramp using two contact
% methods.  It compares contact bewteen two solids with contact between a
% point cloud and a solid. The number of points in the point cloud can be
% varied.  To maintain the same penetration, the stiffness parameter is
% scaled with the number of points.  Fewer points, however, results in more
% speed variation as the cylinder rolls down the ramp.
