%% Bouncing Ball With Zero Crossings
% 
% This example models a ball bouncing on a floor using the Spatial Contact
% Force block.  MATLAB scripts explore the effect of enabling and disabling
% zero crossings and the effect of solver settings on the simulation
% results.

% This plot shows the height of the ball with time if the test is conducted
% with a thin floor.  If the step size is too large, the ball can pass
% through the floor between simulation steps.  Enabling zero-crossings can
% help but may not guarantee the event of the ball hitting the floor will
% always be captured.

%
% This plot shows the height of the ball with time if the test is conducted
% with a thin floor.  If the step size is too large, the ball can pass
% through the floor between simulation steps.  Limiting the maximum step
% size is a better way to ensure the event will be captured.
