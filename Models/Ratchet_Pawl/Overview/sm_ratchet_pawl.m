%% Ratchet Pawl Mechanism
%
% This example models a ratchet with a locking pawl.  The arm pushes the
% driving pawl to rotate the ratchet wheel.  The locking pawl holds the
% ratchet wheel in place while the arm reverses direction. Planar contact
% modeling geometry is used to streamline computation.

% This plot shows the extrusion data for the pawl.  This was created in
% MATLAB and was used to generate the location for the frame where the

%% Wheel
%
% The wheel subsystem models the mass and inertia of the wheel, contact
% geometry for the edges of the wheel, and contact forces between the wheel
% and pawls.  A Simscape Bus is used to group the geometry connections for
% each of the line segments representing the teeth edges.

%
% The rotational speeds of the wheel and driver arm are plotted below.  The
% arm and wheel rotate at nearly the same speed as the driver arm rotates
% counterclockwise.  The wheel stays nearly still as the drive arm rotates
% clockwise.  The spikes in the wheel speed are due to the contact forces
% between the pawls and the wheel.
